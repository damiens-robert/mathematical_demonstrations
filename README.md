The mathematical demonstrations must be considered as PSEUDOCODE.

The PSEUDOCODE which is demonstrated to be a METALANGUAGE in this very documents is protected as any other type of Program where the word Program is defined by The GPLv3 and any following derivatives.

It is obvious but I will noneless state it that any LANGUAGE derivated from the PSEUDOCODE falls into the protection of GPLv3 and following.
